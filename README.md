Maze
====

A fun project for demonstrating and learning about simple JavaScript inheritance and object orientation.

To run the app, simply fork and/or clone the project then launch the index.html file in any modern browser.  Alternatively, you can see it live here: http://danlynn.github.io/Maze/

Try adding MazeRunner instances into the maze by clicking on the maze.  If you shift-click on the maze then it will add another RightMazeRunner instance.  The various maze runners will continue to run through the maze until they find the exit and stop.  The maze itself will stop being dug once all open space has been dug.
